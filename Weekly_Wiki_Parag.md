Week 8 (13 Nov to 18 Nov) : Update 2nd stage of game and heads up display for scores.
XP Value : Simplicity: Started with implementing the various design pattern in pure object oriented paradigm. Moved on to next level by incorporating the same in the JS that is not pure Object Oriented Language. Achieved the same goals through prototypal chain, that one gets through inheritance. 

Week 7 (5 Nov to 12 Nov) : Implementing and designing game play screen and adding coins and enemy entitiy.
XP Value : Simplicity -
I ensured that the team has a simplistic view of the requirements while not having to introduce unnecessary complexity. I achieved this by helping to design simple task for each team members , keeping the focus on what is important and leaving out the rest.

Week 6 (29 Oct to 4 Nov) : Indentifying and applying state pattern on bullet collision with enemy entities.
XP Value : Communication : Encouraged deeper communication in the team as the project development continues addressing increasingly complex issues. 

Week 5 (22 Oct to 28 Oct) : 
Configuring collision setting on different type of entities in the world.
XP Value: See the whole : Ensured that team is keeping the end goal in mind while diving into some of the specific programming challenges faced so far. This helped in keeping the efficiency high within the team.

Week 4 (14 Oct to 21 Oct):
Applying design patterns between objects in the game and testing which patterns works the best. Using chain of responsibily and Composite design patterns.
XP Value : I ensured that the team has a simplistic view of the requirements while not having to introduce unnecessary complexity. I achieved this by helping to design simple task for each team members , keeping the focus on what is important and leaving out the rest.

Week 3 (1 Oct to 7 Oct):

XP Value : See the Whole : In this week I made sure the team has made overall developement, we finalised the game today we discussed all the game features also divided the task to be completed for next week

Week 2 (24 sept to 30 sept) :
Functional Requirements analysis 2:
a. The user should be able to choose a alias which would be used to associate a high score with it.
b. The welcome screen should show the top 5 high scores.
c. Users must be able to see the controls using a control menu.
d. The user should be able to choose the difficulty level of the game from Easy, Medium, Hard.
e. Some enemy units must a defined attack area.
f. Some enemy units must have no bounded area of attack.

XP Value : Communication
To encouraged communication between each member of team, I suggested allocating individual time slots during the weekly meetings which ensured proper attention of every aspect of the project. Moreover, I ensured that the communication is focused and deep enough to be able to indentify key additions and improvments to the project.

Week 1 (17 sept to 23 sept) :

Functional Requirements analysis 1:

a. The system must allow user to start a game simply by going to the website and pressing start.

b. The system must allow user to control his/her avatar using the keyboard. For e.g.

Up arrow : To jump
Down arrow : To duck
Right arrow : To move forward
Left arrow : To move backward
Space bar : To shoot
c. The system must allow user to progress in game either by reaching a certain milestone or defeating a boss.

d. The system must allow user to interact with the world's components. For e.g. Collecting virtual coins by touching them or killing a bot player by shooting it.

e. The system must present some kind of challenges/difficulty to the user. For e.g. user can loose a life by touching a bot player.

XP Value : Simplicity
I ensured that the team has a simplistic view of the requirements while not having to introduce unnecessary complexity. I achieved this by helping to design simple task for each team members , keeping the focus on what is important and leaving out the rest.
