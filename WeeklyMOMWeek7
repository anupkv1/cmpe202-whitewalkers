Last week was about continuing with the coding part also, we integrated a few modules. 
Team suggested few methods of integration where I made sure that each team member's idea is taken into consideration. 
All members in the team actively listened to each others strategies and gave suggestions. We discussses problems that might arise 
after intergration and what measures needed to be followed to avoid it. After integration of each module it is important to perform testing
