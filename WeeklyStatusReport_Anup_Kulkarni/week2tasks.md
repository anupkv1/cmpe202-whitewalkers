Tasks for week2 – 9/23/17- 9/30/17
1.	Code walk through - melon js: Continuing from last week’s development work of the demo that was built using melon js, this week I gave a code walk through and a live demo to the team members also discussed the implications of using melon js framework in the game. 
2.	Also provided a suggestion that it is a good idea to go through the code and understand the patterns used in existing game and how we can extend some of those functionalities to add new features. The motive behind following this approach is that we often while working in a professional environment, don’t get to develop a product from scratch. It is essential to study and understand code that is developed by other developers, draw uml diagrams based on the existing code and then modify the code to add/extend new features.
3.	In that regard, we discussed games on: https://github.com/melonjs/melonJS/wiki/made-with-melonJS  to explore existing games that are built using Melon js and understand how they are built. We selected 1 games and brainstormed the way game had been developed. I observed how Melon js framework is used in building these games and how various features like move forward, back, jump is implemented in these games.  I also downloaded the source and ran the game in local host. 
4.	This discussion further helped us to decide on the game that we need to develop. Once we decided the game, I took the initiative to decide the features that the game should have. After the discussion we listed features like game stages, game player, map, enemies, points collections, landing page UI etc. I asked team members to take one feature each to understand the working of that feature and how to implement that feature in our game. I assigned working on UI wireframes and the creation of the map for the game.  More details are captured in minutes of meeting that I have updated in the main project page.
5.	After this discussion, one of our team mate Abhishek demoed and explained the code that he checked in last week regarding JavaScript Ramp up. This discussion was helpful for me, to understand features in Java Script. 	
6.	Discussed coding standards related to using java script object and attributes usage in project
7.	I also did some research on Melon js name space known as Melon JS engine: 
•	All melonJS functions are defined inside of this namespace
•	Adding a new property to this namespace isn’t generally recommended 
•	Also, researched through melon js classes.
