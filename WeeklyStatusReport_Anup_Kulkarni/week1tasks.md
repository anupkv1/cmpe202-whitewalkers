Tasks for week2 – 9/16/17-9/23/17

Update - 1:

Started going through the official Melon Js document here: http://melonjs.org/

Update - 2:

Also studying Melon Js platformer tutorial accessing the following source: http://melonjs.github.io/tutorial-platformer/ This helps in creating a sample game using melonjs framework.

Update - 3:

Setup to create a simple web-based game using Melon js.

Make sure you have Nodejs installed, if not install node js from: http://nodejs.org
The tile map editor installed and running. Install tile map editor from http://www.mapeditor.org
Sample Data files from http://melonjs.github.io/tutorial-platformer/tutorial_data.zip
Download the melon js boilerplate using the following link: https://github.com/melonjs/boilerplate/archive/master.zip or using git clone https://github.com/melonjs/boilerplate.git
Download the melon js library from http://www.melonjs.org/download.html
If cloned from git, then inside the cloned directory do npm install
Install grunt globally npm install -g grunt-cli
Run the game using: grunt serve (recommended way) -or- If you just want to use the filesystem, the problem is you'll run into "cross-origin request" security errors. With Chrome, you need to use the "--disable-web-security" parameter or better "--allow-file-access-from-files" when launching the browser
