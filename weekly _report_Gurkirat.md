1st week (Sep 17 to Sep 23)

Following research work done:
1. Design patterns- They are the procedures used to construct the software design.
2. Object oriented design patterns demonstrate relationships and dependencies between classes and objects.
3. Three types of design patterns: A. Creational B. Structural C. Behavioral
4. Observer pattern- One of the behavioral design patterns, that define a one-to-many dependency between objects where the one main object is called a subject and the many other objects that depend on subject are called as observers. Observer pattern makes sure that state change in the subject results in all its observers being notified and updated automatically.

XP value: Respect
As I was out of study due to broken arm, I managed to come back just in time to complete my weekly job so that my teammates don't get pressurized to cover my job.


2nd week (Sep 24 to Sep 30)

1. Further study of design patterns.
2. Determining scoring system for game. As we have decided that in our game, there will be a character killing some enemies and also collecting fruits. I am doing the fruits part and studying to develop class structures for different fruits. For eg: which fruit will give how many points. Furthermore there will be negative scoring for some fruitstoo.

XP value: Courage
As we decided to add more action to our game by adding fruits as well as enemies. Therefore, there will be 2 different functions for our hero: One to kill the enemies, and other to collect fruits as well.


3rd week (Oct 1 to Oct 7)

Studied the following:
1. Studying and learning melonJS.
2. Tiled map editor
3. Boilerplate
4. Head up display- to show scoring for our game.

XP value: Communication
As I am working on scoring system for game, communicating with team mates is very important as I am only working on scoring by collecting fruits. There are other ways of scoring too, like killing enemies and running and jumping through map etc, on which other people are working. Therefore, talking with everybody to decide final scoring system.
