Tracking the weekly progress of the Project

Week 1 (17 sept to 23 sept) : Knowledge transfer on :

Basics tenets of Javascript.
Object Oriented Programming concepts in Javascript
First Class Functions.
Prototypal Inheritance
Class concepts in "use strict" mode
XP Value : Courage In this week there was a big dilemma on what technology should we proceed with, Java or JavaScript, 
since some of my team mates want to follow a safer path for Java since they had good hands on, 
they were quite apprehensive in choosing JavaScript for this project. So i took the lead on sharing the tenets of 
JavaScript with my team mates and shared its vast scope in the field of development. 
Through all this motivation they got some courage.

Week 2 (24th sept to 30th sept) :

Studied some basics of design patterns in JavaScript
Implemented and tested Prototype pattern
Implemented and tested Revealing Prototype Pattern
Analyzing the code from various repos of Github for understanding game development in melonJS.
XP Value : Simplicity Being new to the JS, i started with implementing the very basic code of Objects,
Constructor functions and Prototypal Inheritance. Getting a strong grasp on these basics concepts i took these 
concepts to implement various design patterns in JS.



Week 3 (1st oct to 7th oct) :

Analyzed different design patterns
Compared the best possible scenarios for Factory, Abstract Factory, Singleton and Builder.
Studied and practices Creation complex structures using Builder pattern.
Hands on to MelonJS
XP Value : Courage JS being not so modular unlike other OOP languages have many major challenges in implementing the complex design patterns. The earlier version of code were not very modular as being discussed, this code was no close to good industry standards so decided not to check-in that code and provide some better optimized solution in coming weeks.

Week 4 (15th oct to 21st oct) :

Analyzed the diff MelonJS codes Analyzed different design pattern that could be incorporated for our Game.

XP Value : Simplicity Started with implementing the various design pattern in pure object oriented paradigm. Moved on to next level by incorporating the same in the JS that is not pure Object Oriented Language. Achieved the same goals through prototypal chain, that one gets through inheritance



Week 5 (22nd October to 28th October):
Analysed the key binding functionalties of movement.
Scrum Value : Focus 
There was a well defined target i had for this iteration's target. One major task was on how to manipulate the players based on some keyevents. Focused on this goal and was able to maps some keys to the actual features. Will work with same focus for teh coming interations



Week 6 (29th October to 4th November):
Analysed the key binding functionalties of movement and enemy initialization.
Analysing the Incorporation of Command Pattern
Scrum Value : Focus 
Focus on the design features by implementing a design pattern 


Week 4 (4th November to 11th November):
Initialization of Enemy Object Params
Command Design Pattern
Enemy key binding analysis
Scrum Value : Commitment 
With the predefined targets for this sprint, we were able to commit towards the goals in to do list .
