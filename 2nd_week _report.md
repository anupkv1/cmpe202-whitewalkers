1. Further study of design patterns.
2. Determining scoring system for game. As we have decided that in our game, there will be a character killing some enemies and also collecting fruits. I am doing the fruits part and studying to develop class structures for different fruits. For eg: which fruit will give how many points. Furthermore there will be negative scoring for some fruitstoo.

XP value: Courage
As we decided to add more action to our game by adding fruits as well as enemies. Therefore, there will be 2 different functions for our hero:
One to kill the enemies, and other to collect fruits as well.
