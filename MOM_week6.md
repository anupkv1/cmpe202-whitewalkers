Minutes of Meeting -Week 6 (29th October to 4th October)

Following topics were discussed:

1. Analysing the game requirements and determining which design patterns we can implement.
2. Deciding the changes we need to make in our existing strategy. For example- First we decided to have different levels like easy, 
medium and hard, right from the beginning. But now we decided to implement those with the progression of the game.
3. Working on problems that individuals are having.
4. Collabrating the work. For example- Scoring is a task everybody is working on, because it has so many factors like level, enemies
etc. Therefore gathering all different procedures.
