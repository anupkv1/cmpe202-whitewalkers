1st week (Sep 17 to Sep 23)

Following research work done:
1. Design patterns- They are the procedures used to construct the software design.
2. Object oriented design patterns demonstrate relationships and dependencies between classes and objects.
3. Three types of design patterns: A. Creational B. Structural C. Behavioral
4. Observer pattern- One of the behavioral design patterns, that define a one-to-many dependency between objects where the one main object is called a subject and the many other objects that depend on subject are called as observers. Observer pattern makes sure that state change in the subject results in all its observers being notified and updated automatically.

XP value: Respect
As I was out of study due to broken arm, I managed to come back just in time to complete my weekly job so that my teammates don't get pressurized to cover my job.


2nd week (Sep 24 to Sep 30)

1. Further study of design patterns.
2. Determining scoring system for game. As we have decided that in our game, there will be a character killing some enemies and also collecting fruits. I am doing the fruits part and studying to develop class structures for different fruits. For eg: which fruit will give how many points. Furthermore there will be negative scoring for some fruitstoo.

XP value: Courage
As we decided to add more action to our game by adding fruits as well as enemies. Therefore, there will be 2 different functions for our hero: One to kill the enemies, and other to collect fruits as well.


3rd week (Oct 1 to Oct 7)

Studied the following:
1. Studying and learning melonJS.
2. Tiled map editor
3. Boilerplate
4. Head up display- to show scoring for our game.

XP value: Communication
As I am working on scoring system for game, communicating with team mates is very important as I am only working on scoring by collecting fruits. There are other ways of scoring too, like killing enemies and running and jumping through map etc, on which other people are working. Therefore, talking with everybody to decide final scoring system.


4th week (Oct 15 to Oct 21)

Extending the topics of 3rd week, following topics are studied:
1. MelonJS
2. Map development on Tiled.
3. behavioral design patterns:-
   a) Chain of responsibility
   b) Command
   
XP value: Simplicity
While learning to work on Tiled, I started with developing simplest designs from tutorials, just following their instructions. Subsequently with little bit practice, little complexity was added to designs to make the interface better looking and more functional for our hero in the game.


5th week (Oct 22 to Oct 28)

Starting with the code work, working on different levels that the player will go through during the game progression. Beginning from level 1, player will reach higher levels by crossing the obstacles and enemies. 
Also working on the contents that will be displayed on the home screen of our game. So far, we have decided to keep following attributes on the title screen:
a) Title of the game
b) Start button
c) players with high scores
d) Facility for players ton enter their username.

Scrum value: Openness
Due to my broken hand, I was giving all missed assignments today. Therefore,it was tough for me to study for both project and assignments. However, my team members had faith in me and I was able to do both tasks appropriately. 
 

6th week (Oct 29 to Nov 4)

Trying to implement the design patterns in code, especially the iterator pattern. In addition to that, working on the enhancement in difficulty of the game as the hero proceeds in the game. It will be easy to play in the beginning. But it will keep on getting tough as the player goes on. For example, we can increase the movement speed of hero, or the density of enemies will keep on increasing.

Scrum value: Courage
In the early plannings, we were thinking about having different difficulty levels right from the beginning. But as the discussions proceeded, we decided to change our strategy by opting just one play style and adding the new difficulty after each certain part of game is played.


7th week (Nov 5 to Nov 11)

Following work done this week:
1. Worked on scoring system.
2. Procedure for hero's death. For eg: how many hits it takes to kill our hero.

Scrum value: Focus
Working on scoring system is one of the most complex part. And thats why, we cooperated and concentrated this week to sort out our scoring system


8th week (Nov 12 to Nov 18)

Following work done this week:
1. Implementing chain of responsibility design pattern.
2. Integrating scoring system complexities.

Scrum value: Commitment
Approaching last sprint and also the last month of semester, even though there is heap of workload, everybody is committed to complete all work in time.
