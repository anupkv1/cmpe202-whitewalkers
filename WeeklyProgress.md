Tracking the weekly progress of the Project

Week 1 (17 sept to 23 sept) : Knowledge transfer on :

Basics tenets of Javascript.
Object Oriented Programming concepts in Javascript
First Class Functions.
Prototypal Inheritance
Class concepts in "use strict" mode
XP Value : Courage In this week there was a big dilemma on what technology should we proceed with, Java or JavaScript, 
since some of my team mates want to follow a safer path for Java since they had good hands on, 
they were quite apprehensive in choosing JavaScript for this project. So i took the lead on sharing the tenets of 
JavaScript with my team mates and shared its vast scope in the field of development. 
Through all this motivation they got some courage.

Week 2 (24th sept to 30th sept) :

Studied some basics of design patterns in JavaScript
Implemented and tested Prototype pattern
Implemented and tested Revealing Prototype Pattern
Analyzing the code from various repos of Github for understanding game development in melonJS.
XP Value : Simplicity Being new to the JS, i started with implementing the very basic code of Objects,
Constructor functions and Prototypal Inheritance. Getting a strong grasp on these basics concepts i took these 
concepts to implement various design patterns in JS.
