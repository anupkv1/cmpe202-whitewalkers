XP Value: Simplicity 
To ensure simplicity, I tried to keep the scope of the project (Game) more focused to basic functionality instead to adding complex feature. Additionally, I recommended creating small tasks that could be achieved in a week and we have MVP at end of each week. 

Week-1 (17-Sept to 23-Sept) Status Report
