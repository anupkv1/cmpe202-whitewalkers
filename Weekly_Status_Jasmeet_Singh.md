XP Value: Simplicity 
To ensure simplicity, I tried to keep the scope of the project (Game) more focused to basic functionality instead to adding complex feature. Additionally, I recommended creating small tasks that could be achieved in a week and we have MVP at end of each week. 

Week-1 (17-Sept to 23-Sept) Status Report

Abstract Factory and Factory Method
Factory method defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Abstract factory provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying there concrete object.
